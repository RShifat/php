# php

# Download the zip file and extract first 

For run php file you have to server in your device .

*** I recommended install " XAMPP CONTROL PANAL " for localserver 

*** After installing xampp downloaded file save into htdocs folder in xampp software 

*** When run the file first open xampp then start APACHE for run php file . { Start MYSQL for database (if needed) for database home page click  " admin " in the mysql }
